# Restful

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/flatiron/restful.png)](http://travis-ci.org/flatiron/restful)

Creates [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) [Director](http://github.com/flatiron/director) routers for [resourceful](http://github.com/flatiron/resourceful) models. Can be used as a stand-alone module or as a [Flatiron](http://github.com/flatiron/) plugin.

# Installation

     npm install restful


# Explanation

### Core Mappings

  By default, `restful` will map the following `Resourceful` methods.

    POST    /creatures    => Creature.create()
    GET     /creatures    => Creature.all()
    GET     /creatures/1  => Creature.show()
    PUT     /creatures/1  => Creature.update()
    DELETE  /creatures/1  => Creature.destroy()

  The `Director` router will now dispatch all RESTFul urls for the Creature resource

### Non-strict Mappings

Since not all HTTP clients support PUT and DELETE verbs ( such as forms in web browsers ),
restful map also map the following browser friendly routes:

If you prefer to not use this option, set { strict: true }

    POST  /creatures/1/update  => Creature.update()
    POST  /creatures/1/destroy => Creature.destroy()

You might also want to consider using a rails-like approach which uses the convention of a reserved `<form>` input field called "_method" which contains either "PUT" or "DELETE"

   see: https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/middleware/methodOverride.js

### Exposing Arbitrary Resourceful Methods

In many cases, you'll want to expose additional `Resourceful` methods through your router outside of the included: `create`, `all`, `show`, `update`, `destroy`.

Restful has built in support for easily exposing arbitrary resource methods as `Director` routes.

Simply create a new method on the `Resource`.

    Creature.feed = function (_id, options, callback) {
      callback(null, 'I have been fed');
    }

Then, set it to remote to let `restful` it's safe to expose this method to the world.

    Creature.feed.remote = true

It's easy as that! Now, you will have the following mappings in your `Director` router.

    POST    /creatures/1/feed    => Creature.feed()
    GET     /creatures/1/feed    => Creature.feed()

# Usage

``` js
  var http        = require('http'),
      restful     = require('../lib/restful'),
      resourceful = require('resourceful');

  //
  // Create a new Creature resource using the Resourceful library
  //
  var Creature = resourceful.define('creature', function () {
    //
    // Specify a storage engine
    //
    this.use('memory');
    //
    // Specify some properties with validation
    //
    this.string('type');
    this.string('description');
  });

  //
  // Create a new Director routing map based on "Creature" resource
  //
  var router = restful.createRouter(Creature);

  //
  // Setup a very simple HTTP server to serve our routing map!
  //
  var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    req.chunks = [];
    req.on('data', function (chunk) {
      req.chunks.push(chunk.toString());
    });

    router.dispatch(req, res, function (err) {
      if (err) {
        res.writeHead(404);
        res.end();
      }
      console.log('Served ' + req.url);
    });
  });
  console.log('server started on port 8000 - try visiting http://localhost:8000/explore')
  server.listen(8000);
```


# Tests

     npm test

# TODO

 - Full `resourceful` property type support ( numeric, boolean, array, object )
 - Full `resourceful` nested property schema support
 - Implement and document browser support
 - Improve Tests
 - Add better error support via `errs` library
